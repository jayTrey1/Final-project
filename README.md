# Future Goals:
## These are goals that I hope to acheive after graduating

1. I plan on hopefully moving to either Washington or Florida, where I will pursure my career in either software or cybersecurity engineering.
2. I plan on competiting in a bodybuilding competition.
3. I want to travel to Australia, specifically Sydney, Melbourne, or Surfers Paradise.
4. I also plan on adopting a puppy, either a Husky, Doberman, or Australian Shepard dog. Honestly anything that isn't an ankle biter(small dogs).

Here is a link on what to know when planning a trip to Australia!

# Seattle
## Why a city in Washington has sparked my curiosity:
<p>
  I've been drawn to Seattle ever since I watched a show called "The Real World" on MTV. The show was comprised of participants who all lived together in a giant loft, and had to learn how to live with one another, and get jobs in the city. For whatever reason, I've been hooked on the dream of living in the city on the Sea ever since. Joining the I.T. field has also made me more determined to move here as well, as many big tech companies either started in Seattle, or have locations in and or around the city. I also love the idea of being next to water and last but not least... rain!! I feel that rain is extremely calming, and relaxing to be in for some odd reason. Not sure when I will be able to pursure this dream, but I know that I will make it a reality (not to sound cheezy).
